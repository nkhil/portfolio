# My portfolio site

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nikhil and this is the repository for [my portfolio site](https://nikhilvijayan.com). 

**Tech stack**

- [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org) to build the static site using React components.
- [styled-components](styled-components.com) for styling
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment & continuous integration

I've also used a few Gatsby plugins (`gatsby-remark-prismjs` for instance) that made life very easy thanks to [the excellent documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone or fork the repo & Install dependencies**

    ```sh
    # Clone this repo & install depedencies
    git clone https://github.com/nkhil/portfolio.git
    cd portfolio
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Start developing**


    ```sh
    npm start
    
    # P.S. npm develop also works
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site should be running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
