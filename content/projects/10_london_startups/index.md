This is what it says on the tin. It's a website that lists startups from London.

Here's the website: [startupsinlondon.xyz](https://startupsinlondon.xyz)

You can use the search function, or the dropdown to filter companies based on their business category (fintech, health etc).

I've been wanting to play around with Next.js for a while, as it's meant to be quite powerful, allowing you to render pages statically, making the API calls at build-time, or making API calls per request very trivially.
