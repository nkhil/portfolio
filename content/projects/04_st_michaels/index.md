![Nikhil Vijayan Gatsby static site](./st-michaels-school.png)

[Live website](https://vigilant-roentgen-6c50d2.netlify.com/)

[Github project](https://github.com/nkhil/school-test)

This is a Gatsby static site I built for a friend's school in Ahmednagar (India).

The site uses: 

- Gatsby.js (and various Gatsby plugins)
- Styled Components
- CSS media queries for responsiveness
- Netlify for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)
- Netlify CMS to allow for easy content editing

All the CSS used on this project is vanilla, as I'm not yet familiar with any CSS frameworks.
