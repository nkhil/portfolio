I've now been working as a full-time backend engineer for a few months now - building, testing and maintaining microservices. I remember the most obvious HTTP response codes (200, 201, 500, 404 etc), but often needed to fire up Google to see what the odd 4\*\* status code might mean, or what the difference between a 301 and a 302 code is.

I love making little tools that make life easier - so I made this simple offline reference tool to find summaries of what a reference code means. I actually tend to use it more than I expected. Also, I learned some rudimantary web scraping while making it which is a nice bonus.
