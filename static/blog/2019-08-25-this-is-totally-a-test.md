Sunny day, sweepin' the clouds away. On my way to where the air is sweet. Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street? Come and play, everything's A-OK. Friendly neighbors there, that's where we meet. Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?



Well we're movin' on up, to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the sky. Movin' on up, To the east side. We finally got a piece of the pie. Fish don't fry in the kitchen, beans don't burn on the grill. Took a whole lotta tryin' just to get up that hill. Now we're up in the big leagues, gettin' our turn at bat. As long as we live, it's you and me baby, There ain't nothin' wrong with that. Well we're movin' on up, to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the sky. Movin' on up, to the east side. We finally got a piece of the pie.



Sometimes the world looks perfect, nothing to rearrange. Sometimes you just, get a feeling like you need some kind of change. No matter what the odds are this time, nothing's going to stand in my way. This flame in my heart, and a long lost friend gives every dark street a light at the end. Standing tall, on the wings of my dream. Rise and fall, on the wings of my dream. The rain and thunder, the wind and haze. I'm bound for better days. It's my life and my dream, nothing's going to stop me now.
